While these methods have transformed areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and computer graphics, their application in robotics remains largely underexplored. This workshop will address this emerging area by bringing together leading researchers and practitioners in robotics to share insights on the latest advancements, methodologies, and best practices. It will feature invited talks from academic and industrial leaders and technical paper presentations discussing groundbreaking approaches and robotic systems that leverage foundation models and neuro-symbolic AI. The workshop will also explore current challenges, future research directions, and promote interaction through poster sessions and spotlight talks. Call for Workshop Papers We invite submissions for this upcoming workshop, focusing on foundation models, neuro-symbolic AI, generative models, and their applications for robotics. The covered topics strictly align with the recent IJRR Special Issue on “Foundation Models and Neuro-Symbolic AI for Robotics” . Submission site opens on Feb 1, 2025, closes on Mar 2, 2025 ; Notification on Apr 6, 2025; Camera-ready on Apr 20, 2025; Pacific Time (PT). Format: 4 pages excluding acknowledgement, references, and unlimited appendix. Please use the ICRA’25 main conference template (IEEE conference style). Our primary goal is to foster meaningful discussions and idea exchanges between workshop paper authors and the invited speakers . Therefore, we only accept 4-page short papers, which will not be considered formal publications. Authors may therefore either submit their summarized recent published/accepted results (E.g., IJRR, TRO, and venues selected by roboranking.org ) or new ideas with preliminary and unpublished results . This policy allows authors to further develop or resubmit their work to other top-tier venues. Accepted workshop papers will be archived at OpenReview and will be promoted to a broader audience through various media channels. Please note that we use OpenReview for paper reviewing, but reviewer comments will remain confidential , similar to a traditional review process. The reviewing will be single blind . All authors of accepted workshop papers will be required to present their work in a poster session . Authors of outstanding submissions will be invited to deliver an oral presentation during the seminar listed below. Best paper awards will be presented by the IEEE RAS Technical Committee (TC) on Computer & Robot Vision (CRV) . To be eligible for these awards, authors must join the IEEE RAS TC on CRV (which is free) through the IEEE Membership Portal .
